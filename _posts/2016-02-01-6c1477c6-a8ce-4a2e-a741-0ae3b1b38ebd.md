**c1801**

They say that less is more. If you believe this adage, like I do, you can begin to reduce the levels of complication within your life. I have eaten majestic feasts of food that have contained innumerable ingredients and whilst this has been a very fine thing indeed, take a slice of bread, some cheese and butter and introduce heat and the resulting cheese on toast is to die for.

If you can look at the design of piece of jewellery such as say a necklace, the size, shape, precious metals, stones and colours can create something simply wonderful and exuberant but a single diamond resting delicately against the feminine neckline it adorns is perfection.

Practically everything that we see and experience everyday at some point in its creation, has had its influence and existence refined and produced by humans. We take for granted turning on the tap and having fresh water flow into the kettle that we in turn make our tea with and drink from a porcelain receptacle. We live in privileged times but how much do we know about the things that surround us. How much do we appreciate the people who created these things? And how much, if any of it, began its creation here, at home, in Britain.

c1801 bears its name to the year that saw the coming together of England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland for the first time to become the United Kingdom of Great Britain. Here, we do not see boundaries. We do not see politics. We see the people. We see where they live, how they live and what they do. We peel back the layers of history, geography and time to bring you their inventions, their designs and more importantly, their story.

All of these are told through our eyes to show you that one word, one single word, still defines Britain today as much as it did in 1801; Great. There are many synonyms for this word that could have been chosen when the union of these countries happened but when you realize the size of our landmass compared to that of other nations, you will soon realize that the opening adage really is true.

Less, most definitely is, more.
